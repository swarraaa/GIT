# Why is it named Git?

The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker" and the name as: "git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.

- Stupid, contemptible and despicable. Simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
- "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actuallyworks for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
- "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh\*t": when it breaks
